                You see, tonight, it could go either way<br>
                Hearts balanced on a razor blade<br>
                We are designed to love and break<br>
                And to rinse and repeat it all again<br><br>
            
                I get stuck when the world's too loud<br>
                And things don't look up when you're goin' down<br>
                I know your arms are reachin' out<br>
                From somewhere beyond the clouds<br><br>
    
                <span class="pinkish">You make me feel</span><br>
                Like my troubled heart is a million miles away<br>
                <span class="pinkish">You make me feel</span><br>
                Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out into space<br>

                I see the light shinin' through the rain<br>
                A thousand colors in a brighter shade<br>
                Needed to rise from the lowest place<br>
                There's a silver lining that surrounds the grey<br><br>
    
                When I get lost, will it come back around?<br>
                Things don't look up when you're goin' down<br>
                I know your arms, they are reachin' out<br>
                From somewhere beyond the clouds<br><br>
    
                <span class="pinkish">You make me feel</span><br>

                Finding magic in all the smallest things<br>
                The way we notice, that's what really matters<br>
